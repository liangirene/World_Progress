# World_Progress
In this project, I delved into the wealth of data available on Gapminder.org, a source for fact-based view of the world and how it has changed. Gapminder.org offers various data visualizations and presentations, along with the raw data that serves as the foundation for this project. My goal was to recreate and expand upon some of the renowned visualizations found on the website. My analysis is divided into two sections: global population growth and global poverty.

## Global Population Growth
Understanding the dynamics of global population growth is crucial, as the world population has reached significant milestones over time. By examining the factors that influence population growth and how they are changing across different regions, I shed light on this important issue. Through the use of overlaid histograms, scatter diagrams, and interactive widgets, I provided insightful visualizations that help uncover patterns and trends.

## Global Poverty
While the global rate of extreme poverty has consistently decreased over centuries, there are still over 600 million individuals living in extreme poverty. In this section, I focused on exploring the trends of extreme poverty worldwide. Through a timeline representation and an interactive world map where circle sizes correspond to the number of people living in extreme poverty, I highlighted the ongoing challenges and progress made in addressing this critical issue.

By leveraging the Gapminder.org dataset and employing data visualization techniques, this project aims to offer a comprehensive and visually engaging analysis of global population growth and poverty trends. We gained valuable insights into the factors shaping our world and the efforts required to create a more equitable and sustainable future.
